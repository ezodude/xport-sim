This is an implementation of an XPORT hardware ethernet interface in ruby.
It allows a programmer to stub out the real hardware unit to enable rapid prototyping.

The XportSimulator simulates an XPORT to allow network/web connectivity using commands received from a serial port interface.

XPORT HTTP Request/Response Serial Protocol:

- Connect: C<IP ADDRESS>/<PORT NO>\n
  Returns 'C' to communicate a connection has been established.
  example: C82.165.199.35/80\n -> 'C'
  
- Do Http Request: GET <HTTP PATH minus Host Name> <HTTP PROTOCOL VERSION>\nHOST:<Server Name>\n\n
  example: GET /~myaccount/scraper.php HTTP/1.0\nHOST:example.com\n\n

Serial Notifications:

- 'D': Disconnected - connection with the server has been lost.
- 'C': Connection Established - a connection with the server has been established.
